## 🎭 Backstory – The Sugarverse Illusion

You were just trying to work out — or were you?

You suddenly wake up inside **Planet Sugar**, a warped world where **oceans are syrup**, debris is made of sugar, and gravity is optional. Each level represents a twisted layer of your subconscious… or someone else's. The world is sweet, soft, and inviting — but something doesn’t feel right.

As you progress, strange visions begin to glitch the world.  
Your sugar bag grows fuller. The chaos intensifies.  
And just when you reach the end — a message hits you like a sugar crash:

> **“Congratulations, you woke up from your dream.”**  
> **“Claim your bag of sugars?”**  
> **418 Error: You’re trying to retrieve sugar earned in a dream from the real world.**
