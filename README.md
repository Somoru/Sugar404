# 🍭 SUGAR:404 – A Surreal Sugar-Packed Dream (418 Hackathon)

Welcome to **SUGAR:404**, a chaotic browser-based fever dream built for the **418 Hackathon at Mahindra University**.  
Inspired by the HTTP 418 code (“I’m a teapot”), this game explores the surreal boundary between **imagination and digital absurdity** — all drenched in syrup, candy, and glitchy illusion.

## 🎭 Backstory – The Sugarverse Illusion

You were just trying to work out — or were you?

You suddenly wake up inside **Planet Sugar**, a warped world where **oceans are syrup**, debris is made of sugar, and gravity is optional. Each level represents a twisted layer of your subconscious… or someone else's. The world is sweet, soft, and inviting — but something doesn’t feel right.

As you progress, strange visions begin to glitch the world.  
Your sugar bag grows fuller. The chaos intensifies.  
And just when you reach the end — a message hits you like a sugar crash:

> **“Congratulations, you woke up from your dream.”**  
> **“Claim your bag of sugars?”**  
> **418 Error: You’re trying to retrieve sugar earned in a dream from the real world.**
